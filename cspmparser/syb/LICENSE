  * Code from the GHC project which is largely (c) The University of
    Glasgow, and distributable under a BSD-style license (see below),

  * Code from the Haskell 98 Report which is (c) Simon Peyton Jones
    and freely redistributable (but see the full license for
    restrictions).

  * Code from the Haskell Foreign Function Interface specification,
    which is (c) Manuel M. T. Chakravarty and freely redistributable
    (but see the full license for restrictions).

The full text of these licenses is reproduced below.  All of the
